    <h2>Recipe for Pizza Dough</h2>
    <p>Whether you're making your first homemade pizza dough surrounded by your family, or a seasoned pizza chef firing up your outdoor woodfire over. This pizza dough is made for you!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 &frac13; cups of all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li>2 &frac14; tsp of active dry yeast.</li>
        <li>1 &frac12; tsp of sugar.</li>
        <li>&frac34; tsp of fine sea salt.</li>
        <li>&frac14; tsp of garlic powder.</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp of olive oil.</li>
        <li>&frac34; cup of warm water.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, add your water warmed to roughly 100 degrees F, sugar, and active dried yeast. Allow the yeast 5-10 minutes to bloom.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl mix your dry ingrediants. Add your Flour, Sea Salt, Garlic Powder.</li>
        <li>Now that your yeast has bloomed, add your olive oil to your water, then gradually add in your flour mixture while mixing.</li>
        <li>Once your dough is fully mixed, in a separate bowl drizzle in some olive oil and coat your bowl. This will help prevent the dough from sticking.</li>
        <li>Give your dough at least 30 minutes to rest in the bowl, covered with cerame wrap. Or, time till the dough doubles in size.</li>
        <li>Once your dough has doubled in size, punch down the dough ball to deflate and remove from your bowl</li><em>If the dough is overly sticky, feel free to lightly flour your working serface, and hands as needed.</em>
        <li>Now that we're ready to start shaping our dough lets go ahead and pre-heat your oven to 425F.</li>
        <li>Slowly strech your dough out into a pizza shape. Do not stretch too thin or aggresively. The dough will want to retain its shape. Stretch it, then give it a minute to rest and move back into shape, then repeat.</li>
        <li>Once shaped out to your desired thickness, move the dough onto your pizza pan lined with partchment paper.</li>
        <li>Add your desired toppings, and place your pizza in your over for 13-15 minutes depending on heat or until your pizza is to the desired cook.</li>

    </ol>
